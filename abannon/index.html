    <h1>Abannon - The Tragedy's first Part</h1>
    <p>
      An indifferent, unmotivated adventurer follows the call of temptation for the first time in forever, and ends up unsealing an evil that ravaged Heaven's hosts ten years prior. With the former seal keeper's unknowing friendship and healing, she sets off as a harbinger of calamity...</br>
      Yet one question remains unanswered for her even as they journey: what is <it>her</it> place between the mortals and the Higher Beings, the mages and the other Realms, the Artists and the dead?
    </p>
    <p>
    Currently in progress, about 80% done. Looking for ways to publish after the beta reading...</br>
    Also planned: Abannon - The Tragedy's second Part; Abannon - Aftermath/Interregnum/Finality; Abannon Never Forever; Abannon - Optional; plus side content.
