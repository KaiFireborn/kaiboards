    <h1>Kaiboards</h1>
    <p>
      Are you using a traditional keyboard right now? Why are they the way they
      are, and what could be done better %1%? The answer spans from size %2%
      over form factor %3% to the layout. Changing the latter is easy on any
      device but is, undeniably, a learning curve %4%. Improving the keyboard
      itself is a great excuse to choose %5% or even design %6% a new input
      device — or anything in-between! This, in turn, opens up new possibilities
      to adjust the layout: where do special symbols go with fewer keys %7%?
      What about the optimal modifier arrangement %8%? Fascinating solutions of
      varying complexity exist; by choosing what's right for you, you're very
      likely to improve your typing comfort and health for years to come. Of
      course, familiar elements like switches and keycaps %9% are still
      applicable. Moreover, there are always further improvements you could make
      to an ergonomic workspace, including alternative pointing devices %10%.
