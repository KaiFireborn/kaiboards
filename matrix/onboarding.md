# General
- https://matrix.kaifireborn.com (and https://jitsi.kaifireborn.com for conferences)
- This is some basic information on my self-hosted Matrix/Synapse setup.
- Matrix is a FOSS messenger protocol with End-to-End-Encryption (which means that even if my server wanted to read your messages, it couldn't, because it *never* sees your messages/media in an unencrypted/readable format in the first place! This is not the case with corporations like Discord, etc). Jitsi is also FOSS and secure.


# How to Begin?

- Go to the link above, then register by inputting your username (will look like `@username:kaifireborn.com`) and password. Do NOT enter any email, the feature is currently not supported. Careful: the registration domain is `matrix.kaifireborn.com`, NOT `matrix.org` or suchlike. 
- Confirm, then enter your _single-use_ registration token.
 
- You can use any client (website, mobile app or desktop software) of your choice. [Element Web](https://element.kaifireborn.com/) and [Fluffychat Web](https://fluffychat.kaifireborn.com/) are hosted here, but feel free to pick any other desktop or mobile client too. They have different features/appearances but are all intercompatible - just log in with the same account and verify between devices.
- Verification is important, because the messages can only be decrypted on your devices. If you don't synchronise your secret keys between different devices/clients, you might pernamently lose access to your message history!
- Normally you can verify by clicking 'Verify' on both devices/sessions/clients, and then comparing the sets of emoji. As a fallback option, make sure to save your Recovery Key from Settings, or you might lose access to your message history!!!

# Coming from discord?

- Spaces are like Discord servers, Rooms are like channels. These can also exist independently of a Space like group chats.
- Voice/video/stream calls are all supported in full quality! (currently only 1:1 calls; For multiple people, please use the Jitsi widget or https://jitsi.kaifireborn.com )
- Federation (so that you can join Matrix servers hosted by others from this domain, just like a `@gmail.com` address can write to an Outlook one) is still WIP.
- So is GIF integration, statuses, custom stickers and so on - although many of these depend on the client. FluffyChat supports statuses, for example.

My own tag is `kf`, so `@kf:kaifireborn.com` in full. Message me!
