# General

- https://matrix.kaifireborn.com - self-hosted, with ee2e (my _never_ sees your messages/media in an unencrypted/readable format, unlike corporations like Discord etc). Based on the FOSS Matrix protocol.

# How to Begin?

- Register by inputting your username (will look like `@username:kaifireborn.com`) and password. Do NOT enter any email, the feature is currently not supported. Confirm, then enter your _single-use_ token. (The registration domain is `matrix.kaifireborn.com`, not `matrix.org` or suchlike.
- You can use any client of your choice. [Element Web](https://element.kaifireborn.com/) and [Fluffychat Web](https://fluffychat.kaifireborn.com/) are hosted here, but feel free to pick any other desktop or mobile client too. They have different features/appearances but are all intercompatible - just enter the same credentials and verify by doing the emoji comparison..
- You'll have to verify every new device by using the old device so that the private keys may be shared, this is the tradeoff between privacy/security and usability. Make sure to save your Recovery Key from Settings, or you might lose access to your message history!!!

# Coming from discord?

- Spaces are like Discord servers, Rooms are like channels. These can also exist independently of a Space like group chats.
- Voice/video/stream calls are all supported in full quality! (currently only 1:1 calls; For multiple people, please use the Jitsi widget or https://jitsi.kaifireborn.com )
- Federation (so that you can join Matrix servers hosted by others from this domain, just like a `@gmail.com` address can write to an Outlook one) is still WIP.
- So is GIF integration, statuses, custom stickers and so on - although many of these depend on the client. FluffyChat supports statuses, for example.

My own tag is `kf`, so `@kf:kaifireborn.com` in full.
