Switches define the typing feel and effort of your keyboard, but can obviously to the aesthetic depending on your keycaps choice. Keycaps are the face of your keyboard – but their texture and shape can, in turn, influence the typing experience.

# Switches

The actual 'buttons' between the electronics and the keycaps that you rest your fingers on.

### Type

Switches come in three (+1) main types:

- Linear. The base variant, behave how one would expect - the more pressure you apply, the farther the key is pressed. Often recommended for gaming.
- Silent linear. Mechanical keyboards are often associated with loud typing noise, but these have long existed specifically to fix that issue. So, no reason not to use a mechanical keyboard at work~
- Clicky. The other extreme: every key makes a sound like a mouse button would. A matter of taste, really.
- Tactile. These can give you extremely pleasant typing experience if you pick the right ones for you. Unlike linear switches, the so-called pressure curve is not a straight line (see graphs below). A tactile switch might be pressed easily, but require more pressure to bottom out, or glide easily down after a stronger initial push, or let you feel a slight tactile bump in the middle. Once again, a matter of preference - but definitely worth experimenting with!

### Profile/Height

Mostly has to do with height. The most present profiles are the classic **MX**-switches and the low-profile (meaning only about half as tall, great for portable keyboards) **Choc**-switches. There are other, more niche variant, like ultra-low laptop butterfly switches and so on.

Also has to do with height: switches that have more of a travel distance to their bottom-out point will offer a differ typing feel than very low ones.

### Weight

The 'weight' of switches tells us how hard one needs to press on a key for it to take effect. Sometimes it's specified more precisely, with **activation force** (force needed so that the computer registers it as a keypress) and **bottom-out force** (force needed to press a switch as far as it goes). This is mainly defined by how strong the spring in the switch is.

Note that MX-switches will have roughly twice as much weight (normally about 50-70g) as Choc-switches (normally about 30-40g) for the same feel, since they're twice as tall.

Lighter switches will help you type faster and with less effort, but alse heighten the possibility of accidental presses and misclicks.
Personally, I most prefer 25g choc switches (see Choc Purples) and 30-35g MX-switches - but again, a matter of preference as well as trial-and-error.

Additionally, keyboard spacing - so how much free space is left between switch rows and columns can be slightly different.

#### Switch modding

Springs, lubing, etc

## How to Pick?

Many sites that sell keyboard switches will also sell a tester - a random or user-picked assortment of switches they've got, one each in bags of a dozen or so. You can put them in an empty keyboard case for a DIY switch tester, but there are some pre-made ones sold out there too.
In truth, you can never know what exactly you want until you try them out, so I can only recommend this option before committing and purchasing 80+ switches for your keyboard of some kind that might look good on paper but you don't like after all... Even then, be aware that switches _will_ sound and feel somewhat different when they're all arranged on a real keyboard as opposed to being isolated and floating.
Part of this is also how individual switch preferences fundamentally are: anecdotally, I didn't think that _Choc sunsets_ would feel too heavy for my fingers once all 50 keys would have them, just like I couldn't know how the ambience of a keyboard filled with _Choc nocturnals_ would be despite having owned 2-3 of each on one such tester.

# Keycaps

### Sets, legends, custom designs

Keycaps are normally chosen by their aesthetics, since that's the most obvious. You'll probably find a better variety compatible with MX switches rathen than Choc ones, but in both cases there are options to design your own ones (color-, layout- and symbol-wise, at least). [FK Keycaps](https://fkcaps.com/) and [YUZU](https://yuzukeycaps.com/) are popular choices.
You could also theoretically 3D print your own keycaps, but these are generally considered lower-quality and require some fiddling.

Another choice you can make is printed legends vs empty/decorative keycaps. The latter gives you more flexibility with ajusting your layout (TODO: link to another article), and you won't regret learning to type while not looking down on your keyboard (if you haven't yet) - both for ergonomics and typing speed!

Of course, aspects like the material, texture or profile are still of some relevance..

### Profiles

The profile can be uniform like KAM or tilted row-wise to make typing more comfortable like Cherry; _Very_ sculpted sets also exist for even better ergonomics (TODO: add example images) More information on traditional keycap profiles [here](https://geekboards.de/blogs/news/the-ultimate-2025-guide-to-keycap-profiles-types-comparisons-and-trends)

Another way to modify the surface of your keyboard is by using _tilters_, (often 3D-printed) pieces between the switch and the keycap. With those you can raise some keys/rows above others, rotate keys or tilt them - all depending on your special ergonomic preferences and how easy/hard it is to reach certain keys.
(TODO: add picture of tilters on Kyria?)

### Misc

The keys your index fingers would rest on in the homerow are often marked with little tactile bumps, called _hovering_ keys.

Keycaps are measured in `u`. A normal, square key would be 1u, while a shift key might be 1.5u or 2u, and a spacebar that's 5-9u.
